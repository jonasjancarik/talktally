# TalkTally

**This app is work in progress.** This README file is mostly AI-written for the time being.

TalkTally is a straightforward, web app designed to assist moderators in managing speaking queues during meetings, conferences, and other events. Its current functionality is basic, focusing on providing moderators with the tools needed to organize speaker sessions in a more structured manner.

## Current Features

- **Speaker Queue Management**: Enables moderators to add and manage the list of speakers, ensuring an organized flow of contributions.
- **Manual Hand-Raising**: Currently, moderators manually add participants to the speaking queue, simulating the hand-raising process.
- **Active Speaker Timer**: Includes a simple timer to track the speaking duration of the active speaker, aiding in time management.

## Getting Started

As a moderator, you can begin using TalkTally by:

1. **Adding Speakers**: Manually input the names of participants who wish to speak, adding them to the queue.
2. **Managing Turns**: Click to start the timer for the active speaker and move through the queue in an organized manner.
3. **Concluding Speeches**: Mark a speaker's turn as finished, which stops their timer and removes them from the active queue.

## Future Enhancements

- **Participant Interaction**: Plans to allow participants to raise their hands through the application, enhancing interactivity and participation.
- **Improved User Interface**: Aiming for a more intuitive and feature-rich interface to accommodate a wider range of user needs.
- **Expanded Moderator Controls**: Additional tools for moderators to manage the discussion more effectively.

TalkTally is in its early stages and welcomes feedback and suggestions for improvement. It's a basic tool for now, but with your input, it can evolve into a more comprehensive platform for managing engaging and inclusive discussions.
